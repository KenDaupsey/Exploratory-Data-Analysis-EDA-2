Exploratory Data Analysis Example 2

This repository contains an example of exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. In this example, we perform an in-depth analysis of a dataset comprising various academic performance metrics and demographic information.

Overview and Data Quality

We begin by loading the dataset from a GitHub URL and inspecting its structure and quality. Information such as data types, missing values, and summary statistics are examined to ensure data integrity.

Exploring Numeric Variables

We analyze the distribution of numeric variables such as reading scores and math scores using visualizations like histograms and boxplots. Additionally, we explore relationships between numeric variables through scatter plots.

Exploring Categorical Variables

Categorical variables like gender and socioeconomic status (SES) are investigated through frequency distributions and cross-tabulations. Chi-square tests are performed to assess the independence between categorical variables.

Identifying Potential Outliers

Boxplots are employed to identify potential outliers in the dataset, allowing us to detect any extreme values that may impact the analysis.

Additional Insights

A correlation matrix visualization is presented to highlight the relationships between numeric variables. Further analysis directions, including investigating variable relationships and handling missing values, are outlined.

For detailed implementation and code snippets, please refer to the provided Jupyter Notebook.

Note: This example is for educational purposes and showcases fundamental techniques in exploratory data analysis.
